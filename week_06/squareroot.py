# Task 6: Square Root
# Programme that uses the Newton-Raphson Method to calculate a square root of x and prints an error message if number is negative.

# Author: Mariane McGrath


# Newtonâ€™s method, also known as Newton-Raphson method is a root-finding algorithm that produces successively better approximations of the roots of a real-valued function.

# First, we ask user to enter a number and convert into a floating point number
# The input () function reads the user input as a string, and float() converts it to a float

# We will build a function called square 

def square_root(num):                                   # We will set an error parameter - if between guesses, the number is less than the defined amount
    if num < 0:                                         # If the number is negative (smaller than 0), then an error message is shown
        print ("Error! I cannot calculate the square root of a negative number.")
    elif num == 0:                                      # We'll check if the number is less than zero, if it is we'll issue an error message
        print ("Error! The square root of 0 is 0.")     # Source: Resource: Matthes, E. (2023) Python Crash Course (3rd edition). San Francisco, US: No Starch Press -- Chapter 7

    guess = num / 2                                     # Our first guess is half of the number
