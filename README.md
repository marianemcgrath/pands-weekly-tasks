In this repository, you'll find my solutions for Programming & Scripting classes, at ATU Galway-Mayo (Year 1/ Semester 1 - 2025)

# **Tasks** üìö 

## Task 1: Hello World! 
 - This program that displays "Hello World!" when it is run

## Task 2: Bank
 - This program, called bank.py, that prompts the user and reads in two money amounts (in cents), adds the two amounts, and prints the answer in the following format: euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.
   
Suggested figures for the test: 
  - Enter amount1(in cent): 65
  - Enter amount2(in cent): 180
  - The sum of these is ‚Ç¨2.45

## Task 3: Accounts
 - A program called accounts.py that reads a 10-character account number and outputs the account number with only the last four digits showing (and the first six digits replaced with Xs). It also includes a modification to the program to deal with account numbers of any length.

Suggested figures for the test: 
- Please enter a 10-digit account number: 1234567890
- XXXXXX7890

## Task 4: Collatz
 - A program called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step, it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, dividing it by two. If the current value is odd, it multiplies it by three and adds one. The program ends when it reaches the value one.

Suggested figures for the test:
- Please enter a positive integer: 10
- 10 5 16 8 4 2 1

## Task 5: Weekday
This program, called weekday.py, determines whether today is a weekday.
- If it is a weekday, display message: "Yes, unfortunately, today is a weekday."
- If it is the weekend, display a different message: "It is the weekend, yay!"

** This program requires no user input.

## Task 6: Square Root
 - This program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
 - This program does not use the built-in functions in Python [x ** .5 **or** math.sqrt(x)]
 - To develop the code, the author researched the Newton method for estimating square roots and used the Babylonian method.

Suggested figures for the test:
- Please enter a positive number: 14.5
- The square root of 14.5 is approximately 3.8

## Task 7: "E" count
- The program, called es.py, reads in a text file and outputs the count of the letter 'e' within the text.
* The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.

Suggested files/ figures for the test:
 - moby-dick.txt
 - 116960

## Task 8: Plot Task
 - This program, called plottask.py, displays the following:
 - A histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2
 - A plot of the function  h(x)=x3 in the range 0 to 10, in the one set of axes
 - A copy of the image of the plot (.png file)
