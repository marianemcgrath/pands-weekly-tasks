# Pands Weekly Tasks

In this repository, you'll find my solutions for Programming & Scripting classes, at ATU Galway-Mayo (Year 1/ Semester 1 - 2025)

Please see below the instructions for each task:

## Task 1: Hello World! 
 - A program that displays "Hello World!" when it is run

## Task 2: Bank
 - A program called bank.py, that prompts the user and reads in two money amounts (in cents), adds the two amounts, and prints the answer in the following format: euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.
   
Suggested figures for the test: 
  - Enter amount1(in cent): 65
  - Enter amount2(in cent): 180
  - The sum of these is â‚¬2.45

## Task 3: Accounts
 - A program called accounts.py that reads a 10-character account number and outputs the account number with only the last four digits showing (and the first six digits replaced with Xs). It also includes a modification to the program to deal with account numbers of any length.

## Task 4: Collatz
 - A program called collatz.py, that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step, it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, dividing it by two. If the current value is odd, it multiplies it by three and adds one. The program end if the current value is one.
